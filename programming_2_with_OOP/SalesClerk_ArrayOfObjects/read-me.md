Suppose you need to keep track of total sales for each sales clerk in a department store.
In the following clerks array, each array element holds a reference for a SalesClerk object.
Each SalesClerk object holds a sales clerk's name and a total-sales value for the sales clerk.
If sales clerk Derrick sells two items for $55.45 and $22.01, then you'd like to store 77.46 for his total-sales value
